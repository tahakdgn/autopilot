# Autopilot: Autonomous TDD Development with Claude Code

A workflow for autonomous, test-driven development using Claude Code. Write a PRD, convert it to tasks, then let Claude implement everything using TDD while you sleep.

Inspired by the [Ralph Wiggum technique](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/), autopilot includes its own built-in loop mechanism - no external plugins required.

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

**New project? Follow this flow:**

```
1. Install autopilot          → ./install.sh (one-time)
2. Initialize your project    → /autopilot init
3. Write a PRD                 → /prd "add user login feature"
4. Generate tasks              → /tasks docs/autopilot/user-login/user-login.md
5. Enable sandbox              → /sandbox
6. Run autopilot               → autopilot docs/autopilot/user-login/user-login.json
```

**Already have a task file?**

```bash
# Recommended: Fresh context per requirement (for 5+ requirements)
autopilot tasks.json

# Alternative: Single session (for 1-4 requirements)
/autopilot tasks.json
```

> **No `autopilot.json` yet?** `/autopilot <task-file>` (and the `tests`/`lint`/`entropy`/`analyze` modes) now **auto-initialize** with detected defaults (`init --force`) and continue in the same session — you no longer have to run `/autopilot init` first. Review the generated `autopilot.json` afterward and adjust feedback loops if needed. Greenfield projects whose feedback-loop tooling is scaffolded by an early requirement are expected and supported; those loops stay enabled and activate once that requirement runs.

**Decision tree:**

```
                    How many requirements?
                           │
              ┌────────────┴────────────┐
              │                         │
           1-4                        5+
              │                         │
              ▼                         ▼
      /autopilot tasks.json    autopilot tasks.json
      (single session,         (fresh context,
       shared context)          token efficient)
```

**Need help?** See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) or run `/autopilot --help`.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) with an active subscription
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) - JSON processor (used by `autopilot` (bash) to check task status)
- On Windows: [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) (all scripts are bash) and, for the two-pane launcher, [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal)
- A project with feedback loops:
  - **Tests** - Any test runner (Jest, Vitest, pytest, go test, RSpec, etc.)
  - **Linter** - Any linter (ESLint, Ruff, golangci-lint, RuboCop, etc.)
  - **Type checker** (optional) - TypeScript, mypy, etc.

## Installation

### 1. Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gens-ai/autopilot.git
cd autopilot
```

### 2. Run the install script

```bash
./install.sh
```

This creates symlinks:
- `~/.claude/commands/prd.md` → repo (slash command)
- `~/.claude/commands/tasks.md` → repo (slash command)
- `~/.claude/commands/autopilot.md` → repo (slash command)
- `~/.claude/AGENTS.md` → repo
- `~/.claude/hooks/autopilot-stop-hook.sh` → repo (loop mechanism)
- `~/.local/bin/autopilot` → repo/`run.sh` (terminal command)
- `~/.local/bin/autopilot-cleanup` → repo/`cleanup.sh` (process cleanup)
- `~/.local/bin/autopilot-status` → repo/`status.sh` (read-only health check)

On Windows (Git Bash) it also drops a `.cmd` wrapper next to each command, so
they run from `cmd.exe` and Windows Terminal too. See [Windows](#windows).

The install script also registers the stop hook in `~/.claude/settings.json` under `hooks.Stop` — the only place Claude Code reads hook configuration from. (Do **not** use `~/.claude/hooks.json`; Claude Code ignores that file.)

Updates to the repo are automatically available (just `git pull`).

**Note:** Ensure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"  # Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
```

### 3. Restart Claude Code

Start a new Claude Code session for the commands to become available.

### 4. Verify installation

```bash
# These commands should now be available:
/prd
/tasks
/autopilot
```

## Workflow

```
/autopilot init          → Initialize project configuration (one-time setup)
/prd feature-name        → Human-readable PRD (you review)
/tasks prd-file.md       → Machine-readable JSON (for autopilot)
/sandbox                 → Enable sandbox mode (highly adivsed for safer autonomy)
/autopilot tasks.json    → Autonomous TDD execution
```

### Pro Tip: Brainstorm First

For best results, start by brainstorming your feature in a markdown file before running `/prd`. Jot down your ideas, requirements, and any technical considerations. Then feed that file to the `/prd` command - Claude will ask clarifying questions to refine your rough ideas into a well-structured implementation plan.

```bash
# Brainstorm your feature
docs/plans/my-feature-brainstorm.md

# Then run /prd with your notes
/prd @docs/plans/my-feature-brainstorm.md
```

The better your initial thinking, the better the output.

## Two Ways to Run Autopilot

There are two ways to execute autopilot, with different tradeoffs:

| Method | Context | Best For |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `autopilot` (bash) | Fresh each requirement | Large task files, overnight runs |
| `/autopilot` | Accumulates in session | Small tasks, interactive use |

### Option 1: `autopilot` bash command (Recommended)

The **wrapper script** runs Claude in a loop, starting a **fresh session for each requirement**. This clears context between requirements, keeping token usage efficient.

```bash
autopilot docs/autopilot/feature/feature.json
```

**How it works:**
1. Checks the task JSON for incomplete requirements
2. Invokes `claude --allowedTools ... "/autopilot <file> --batch 1"`
3. Claude completes one requirement, then exits
4. Script checks for remaining requirements
5. If more remain, starts a new Claude session (fresh context)
6. Repeats until all requirements are complete or stuck

**First-time setup per project:** The first time you run `autopilot` in a new project directory, Claude Code will show a one-time workspace trust prompt ("Is this a project you created or one you trust?"). Accept it once — subsequent sessions in that directory won't prompt again.

**Why fresh context matters:**
- Claude Code's Ralph Loop accumulates context within a session
- After 5-10 requirements, context can exceed limits or degrade quality
- Fresh sessions mean Claude starts clean each time
- State is preserved in the task JSON and notes file, not in memory

**Options:**
```bash
autopilot tasks.json              # 1 requirement per session (most frugal)
autopilot tasks.json --batch 3    # 3 requirements per session (faster)
autopilot tasks.json --model sonnet  # Model for spawned sessions (otherwise: autopilot.json "model", else your Claude default)
autopilot tasks.json --delay 5    # 5 second pause between sessions
autopilot tasks.json --dry-run    # Preview without executing
autopilot tasks.json --cleanup    # Kill stale processes before starting
autopilot /my-command --max 5     # Run slash command 5 times (command loop mode)
autopilot                         # No args: work the project task queue (see Task Queue Mode)
```

**Model options:** `opus` (default), `sonnet`, `haiku`, or full model names like `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`

**When to use:**
- Task files with 5+ requirements
- Running overnight or unattended
- When you want maximum token efficiency
- Large codebases where context matters

**Stopping autopilot:**

Autopilot stops automatically when all requirements are complete—it writes `.autopilot/stop-signal` which tells `run.sh` to exit.

To stop manually, run `/autopilot stop` from another Claude Code session (sends `SIGUSR1` to the PID in `.autopilot.pid`), or press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal. On exit, `run.sh` automatically kills all child processes (MCP servers, subagents, workers) to prevent orphans.

### Option 2: `/autopilot` Slash Command

The **slash command** runs within a single Claude session. Context accumulates between iterations, which can be useful for complex multi-step work where Claude needs to remember previous actions.

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
/autopilot docs/autopilot/feature/feature.json
```

**How it works:**
1. Creates a loop state file with the task prompt
2. Claude works through requirements sequentially
3. The stop-hook intercepts exit attempts and re-feeds the prompt
4. Context accumulates (Claude remembers previous work)
5. Continues until COMPLETE is output or max iterations reached

**Options:**
```bash
/autopilot tasks.json                  # Use default iterations (15)
/autopilot tasks.json 30               # Override to 30 iterations
/autopilot tasks.json --batch 1        # Complete 1 requirement then stop
/autopilot tasks.json --start-from 5   # Resume from requirement 5
```

**When to use:**
- Small task files (1-4 requirements)
- Interactive sessions where you're watching
- When requirements build on each other and shared context helps
- Quick fixes or single features

### Which Should I Use?

**Use `autopilot` (bash) when:**
- You have many requirements to complete
- You're stepping away and want it to run autonomously
- Token efficiency matters
- You've hit context limits with `/autopilot` before

**Use `/autopilot` when:**
- You have a small, focused task
- You're actively monitoring progress
- Requirements are interdependent and benefit from shared context
- You want to use `--start-from` to resume mid-file

### Step 0: Initialize Project (One-Time)

Before using autopilot in a new project, initialize the configuration:

```bash
/autopilot init
```

This command:
1. **Checks your environment** - Verifies git is clean, detects installed tools
2. **Analyzes your codebase** - Detects project type, test patterns, architecture
3. **Configures feedback loops** - Finds your test/lint/typecheck commands
4. **Creates `autopilot.json`** - Saves all settings for autopilot to use

You only need to run this once per project. The resulting `autopilot.json` should be committed to your repository.

**Quick setup with auto-detected values:**
```bash
/autopilot init --force
```

### Step 1: Create PRD

```bash
/prd Add user authentication with email/password
```

Claude asks thorough clarifying questions (as many as needed to fully specify the feature), then generates a markdown PRD at `docs/autopilot/feature-name/feature-name.md`.

**Review and revise until satisfied.** This is your chance to shape the feature before autonomous execution.

### Step 2: Generate Tasks

```bash
/tasks docs/autopilot/user-auth/user-auth.md
```

Before generating tasks, `/tasks` **analyzes your codebase** to understand what exists:

1. **Phase 0: Codebase Analysis** - Searches for related files, patterns, and utilities
2. **Phase 1: Gap Analysis** - For each requirement, determines if it's `create`, `extend`, `modify`, or `already-done`
3. **Phase 2: Task Generation** - Creates enriched JSON with code-aware context
4. **Phase 3: Dependency Inference** - Auto-detects dependencies between requirements

Each requirement includes a `codeAnalysis` object with specific file targets and an `acceptance` array defining testable success criteria:

```json
{
  "requirements": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "description": "User can register with email/password",
      "codeAnalysis": {
        "approach": "extend",
        "existingFiles": ["src/controllers/AuthController.ts"],
        "relatedTests": ["src/__tests__/auth.test.ts"],
        "patterns": ["Controllers extend BaseController"],
        "targetFiles": {
          "modify": ["src/controllers/AuthController.ts"],
          "create": ["src/models/User.ts"]
        }
      },
      "acceptance": [
        "POST /auth/register returns 201 with JWT on valid input",
        "Invalid email returns 400 with validation error",
        "Duplicate email returns 409 conflict"
      ],
      "tdd": {
        "test": { "description": "Add registration tests covering all acceptance criteria", "passes": false },
        "implement": { "description": "Extend AuthController with register endpoint", "passes": false },
        "refactor": { "passes": false }
      },
      "passes": false
    }
  ]
}
```

**Acceptance criteria** define what "done" means for each requirement. Each criterion becomes a test case in the TDD Red phase—Claude must write tests covering ALL acceptance criteria before proceeding to implementation.

**Refresh mode:** If implementation goes off-track, re-analyze with `--refresh`:

```bash
/tasks docs/autopilot/user-auth/user-auth.json --refresh
```

This preserves completed requirements while re-running gap analysis on incomplete ones.

### Step 3: Enable Sandbox

```bash
/sandbox
```

Enables [sandbox mode](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/security#sandbox-mode). This is optional but advised for autonomous runs - it restricts file and network access so Claude can execute commands without permission prompts while your system stays protected.

### Step 4: Run Autopilot

```bash
/autopilot docs/autopilot/user-auth/user-auth.json
```

Claude creates (or checks out) a branch named after the feature, then executes each requirement using TDD:

1. **Branch** - Create or switch to `user-auth` branch
2. **Red** - Write failing test, verify it fails, commit
3. **Green** - Write minimal implementation, verify it passes, commit
4. **Refactor** - Run code-simplifier, verify tests green, commit

All commits land on the feature branch, ready for review or PR creation when done.

Progress is logged to `*-notes.md` alongside the task file. Learnings are appended to `AGENTS.md`.

## Autopilot Modes

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/autopilot init` | Initialize project configuration (one-time setup) |
| `/autopilot stop` | Stop run.sh wrapper gracefully |
| `/autopilot cancel` | Cancel hook-based loop (remove state file) |
| `/autopilot status` | Read-only health check on any active loop - no changes made |
| `/autopilot file.json [N]` | TDD task completion (default: 15 iterations) |
| `/autopilot file.json --start-from 5` | Resume from requirement ID 5 |
| `/autopilot rollback 3` | Rollback to before requirement 3 started |
| `/autopilot tests [target%] [N]` | Increase test coverage (default 80%, 10 iterations) |
| `/autopilot lint [N]` | Fix all lint errors one by one (default: 15 iterations) |
| `/autopilot entropy [N]` | Clean up code smells and dead code (default: 10 iterations) |
| `/autopilot analyze` | Analyze session analytics for improvement suggestions |
| `/autopilot /<command> --max N` | Run any slash command in a loop (default: 10 iterations) |

Pass an optional number `N` to override the default iterations from `autopilot.json`. Lower defaults optimize for token frugality.

**Subcommands** (invoked via the `autopilot` bash wrapper):

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `autopilot` | Work the project task queue (`docs/autopilot/queue.json`), entry by entry |
| `autopilot queue [list]` | Show the queue with derived per-entry status |
| `autopilot queue add <file.json>` | Queue a task file (`--front` to prioritize, `--notes "..."`) |
| `autopilot queue rm\|hold\|unhold\|move` | Remove, pause, release, or reorder entries |
| `autopilot test-stories <domain.md>` | Audit existing features against a domain user story file |

### Task Queue Mode

> **Deep dive:** [docs/queue-mode.md](docs/queue-mode.md) documents the full machinery — the derived-status model, the `autopilot-queue` command reference, the drain loop step-by-step, and every failure mode found (and fixed) while dogfooding it.

Each project can keep an ordered queue of task files so you never have to remember what to run next — `autopilot` with no arguments picks up the first runnable entry and works the queue until it's drained:

```bash
# Queue up task files (also done automatically when /tasks generates one)
autopilot queue add docs/autopilot/user-auth/user-auth.json
autopilot queue add docs/autopilot/billing/billing.json --notes "after auth ships"

# See where things stand
autopilot queue
#   1  done          7/7  docs/autopilot/user-auth/user-auth.json
#   2  queued        0/5  docs/autopilot/billing/billing.json  (after auth ships)
#   Next up: docs/autopilot/billing/billing.json  (run 'autopilot' to start)

# Work the queue: runs each entry to completion in order, fresh sessions per requirement
autopilot
autopilot --batch 3 --model sonnet    # options forwarded to each entry's run
```

**How it works:**
- The queue lives at `docs/autopilot/queue.json` — a small, committed JSON file holding only ordering and intent (`hold`, `notes`, timestamps). Entry **status is derived live** from each task file's own `passes`/`stuck`/`invalidTest` state, never duplicated, so the queue can't drift from ground truth.
- The drain loop runs a full task-mode `run.sh` per entry (same locking, batching, and analytics as running the file directly), then advances when nothing runnable remains in it.
- An entry that ends fully **stuck** is flagged for attention and skipped, not retried forever. An entry whose run was stopped or died mid-way halts the drain rather than plowing ahead.
- Between entries the wrapper returns to the branch it started on, so each feature branches off the same base instead of stacking on the previous feature's branch. Only *new* uncommitted changes introduced by the entry that just ran halt the drain — pre-existing repo cruft and autopilot's own bookkeeping are ignored, so ordinary untracked files don't block an unattended overnight run.
- `autopilot queue hold <file|N>` parks an entry (kept in place, skipped when draining); `unhold` releases it. `move <file|N> <pos>` reorders.
- `/autopilot stop` (or Ctrl+C) stops the drain gracefully — the current requirement finishes, the queue keeps its state, and the next `autopilot` run resumes exactly where things left off.

Statuses shown by `autopilot queue`: `queued` (untouched), `in-progress` (some requirements done, runnable ones remain), `done`, `stuck` (nothing runnable, some requirements blocked), `on-hold`, `missing`/`invalid` (task file gone or malformed — skipped with a warning).

### Command Loop Mode

Run any slash command repeatedly with fresh sessions:

```bash
# Via run.sh (recommended - fresh context per iteration)
autopilot /my-command --max 5           # Run /my-command 5 times
autopilot /review-pr 123 --max 3        # Run /review-pr with args, 3 times

# Via /autopilot directly (single session)
/autopilot /my-command --max 5          # Run in loop within session
```

**Use cases:**
- Repetitive tasks that benefit from fresh context each run
- Batch processing with a custom slash command
- Running a review or analysis command multiple times

**Note:** Use `--max N` to specify iterations. Without it, defaults to 10.

### User Story Testing Mode

Autopilot can audit existing features against a set of user stories, documenting findings inline as it goes — without implementing anything.

```bash
# Test all user stories in a domain file (fresh session per story)
autopilot test-stories docs/testing/domains/01-auth-and-registration.md

# Skip JSON generation (re-run with existing task file)
autopilot test-stories docs/testing/domains/01-auth-and-registration.md --skip-gen

# Use a specific model
autopilot test-stories docs/testing/domains/02-events.md --model sonnet
```

**How it works:**
1. **Generate** — runs `/test-user-stories <domain-file>` once to parse the domain file and produce a task JSON at `docs/autopilot/testing/{domain-name}/{domain-name}.json`
2. **Test** — runs the task JSON with fresh sessions, one per story

Each story's session: navigates to the feature in a browser, inspects the relevant code, writes an inline finding directly into the domain file (`- no issue` / `- fix:` / `- feature:` / `- suggestion:` / `- blocked:`), and checks permission gates. High-stakes stories (payments, permissions, destructive actions) also get a negative browser test as an unauthorized user.

**Setting up a domain file:** See `commands/test-user-stories.md` for the expected format and how to split a large user story document into domain-focused files.

## How It Works

> **Deep dive:** [docs/loop-mechanism.md](docs/loop-mechanism.md) documents the full machinery — the outer run.sh loop, the Stop-hook inner loop, every coordination file (`run.pid`, `loop-state.md`, `stop-signal`), the `--wrapper-pid`/`--state-dir` self-identification flags, hook registration, and the guards against each failure mode.

### Context and State Management

When using `/autopilot` directly, the built-in loop mechanism runs within a single session—**context accumulates** between iterations. This is by design: Claude can see its previous work and self-correct. However, this means long-running tasks may hit context limits.

**To avoid context limits, use `autopilot` (bash)** which starts fresh sessions for each requirement. See [Two Ways to Run Autopilot](#two-ways-to-run-autopilot) above.

Regardless of which method you use, Claude tracks progress through persistent state:
- Reading the task file (completed items marked `passes: true`)
- Reading the notes file (progress log with timestamps)
- Checking git history (all commits from previous iterations)

This persistent state allows seamless resumption across sessions.

### Feature Branches

When running TDD task mode, autopilot automatically creates a branch named after the feature file (e.g. `user-auth.json` → branch `user-auth`). If the branch already exists (e.g. resuming a previous session), it checks it out instead. All TDD commits land on this branch, keeping `main` clean until you're ready to review and merge.

### Token Frugality

Autopilot is optimized for token efficiency:

1. **Low iteration defaults** - Defaults are 10-15 iterations per session. Restart frequently for fresh context.
2. **Read notes first** - Each iteration reads the notes file first to understand current state, avoiding redundant exploration.
3. **Structured notes** - Notes maintain a "Current State" section for quick state reconstruction.
4. **Concise mode** - Claude is instructed to act without explaining, minimizing output tokens.
5. **Targeted reads** - Uses line ranges instead of reading entire files when possible.

### Subagent Parallelization

Claude uses subagents strategically based on the task type:

| Task Type | Strategy | Why |
|-----------|----------|-----|
| File reading | Parallel | No side effects, can read many files at once |
| Grep/search | Parallel | Independent searches, faster exploration |
| Codebase analysis | Parallel | Study multiple areas simultaneously |
| Tests | Sequential | Need to see results before deciding next step |
| Builds | Sequential | Must complete before validating |
| Commits | Sequential | Require backpressure and verification |

**Rule of thumb:** Reading and exploring uses parallel subagents for speed. Writing and executing uses sequential flow with feedback loops.

### Managing Context Limits

**Recommended: Use `autopilot` (bash)** for automatic context management. It handles everything for you.

If using `/autopilot` directly:

1. **Use `--batch 1`** - Complete one requirement per session: `/autopilot tasks.json --batch 1`
2. **Break large task files** - 5-7 requirements per JSON file works well
3. **Restart frequently** - End the session and run `/autopilot` again. Claude reads the JSON and notes file, then continues from where it left off.

Example manual workflow:
```bash
/autopilot tasks.json --batch 1   # Complete 1 requirement
# Session ends
/autopilot tasks.json --batch 1   # Fresh context, next requirement
```

Or let `autopilot` (bash) handle this automatically:
```bash
autopilot tasks.json         # Handles everything, fresh context each requirement
```

### Feedback Loops

Before every commit, autopilot runs:
- `typecheck` - TypeScript compiler
- `tests` - Test suite
- `lint` - Linter

If any fail, Claude fixes the issue before committing.

**Red phase is scoped, Green/Refactor run the full suite.** On a large test suite, running everything three times per requirement (Red, Green, Refactor) adds up. Red only needs to confirm the new test fails, so it runs scoped to just the new test file; Green and Refactor are the actual regression gates before a commit, so they always run the full `tests` command. If the project's test runner doesn't have an obvious way to scope to one file, Red falls back to the full command too.

### Code Simplifier

During the TDD refactor phase, the `code-simplifier` agent runs to improve clarity and maintainability while preserving functionality.

### Stuck Handling

To prevent infinite loops on intractable problems, autopilot includes stuck detection:

1. **Detection** - Same task/error failing for 3 consecutive iterations
2. **Action** - Log the blocker with details to the notes file
3. **Recovery** - Mark task as `stuck: true`, skip to next task
4. **Completion** - Output COMPLETE when done or only stuck items remain

Stuck tasks are logged with a `blockedReason` so you can review and fix manually later.

### Thrashing Detection

**Thrashing** occurs when the same error repeats without meaningful progress—like trying to connect to a database 30 times when the sandbox is blocking the port. This wastes tokens on a fundamentally unsolvable problem.

Autopilot detects thrashing by tracking consecutive identical errors:

1. **Track errors** - Each error is normalized (timestamps/UUIDs stripped) and compared
2. **Detect repetition** - If the same error appears 3+ times consecutively (configurable via `analytics.thrashingThreshold`)
3. **Abort early** - Immediately mark the task as `stuck` with the thrashing pattern

Common thrashing patterns and fixes:

| Pattern | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| `ECONNREFUSED localhost:*` | Sandbox blocking ports | Set `sandbox: false` in feedback loop |
| `Cannot find module` | Missing dependency | Run `npm install` |
| Same test assertion failing | Logic error | Re-read requirement |

### Session Analytics

Autopilot tracks per-session analytics to help identify token waste and improvement opportunities.

**What's tracked (by infrastructure):**
- Requirement status (derived from task JSON)
- Iterations per requirement (commit counts between git tags)
- Files written (git diff between tags)
- Session duration and efficiency score

**What's tracked (by LLM, when available):**
- Errors with type, message, and resolution
- Thrashing events

**Analytics files** are stored in `docs/autopilot/<feature-name>/analytics/` with names like `2026-01-10-user-auth-1.json`.

**Analyze sessions:**
```bash
/autopilot analyze                    # All sessions
/autopilot analyze --last             # Most recent only
/autopilot analyze --since 7d         # Last 7 days
/autopilot analyze --task user-auth   # Specific task
```

The analysis generates:
- **Efficiency score** - Productive vs wasted iterations
- **Waste patterns** - Thrashing, environment issues, missing context
- **Suggested fixes** - Proposed AGENTS.md entries and autopilot.json changes

Suggestions are printed to console for you to review and apply manually. After applying learnings, delete the analytics files:
```bash
rm docs/autopilot/<feature-name>/analytics/*.json
# or
/autopilot analyze --clear
```

**Configuration** in `autopilot.json`:
```json
{
  "analytics": {
    "enabled": true,
    "directory": "docs/autopilot/analytics",
    "thrashingThreshold": 3
  }
}
```

### Resume and Rollback

Autopilot creates git tags before starting each requirement, enabling safe recovery:

**Resume from a specific requirement:**
```bash
# Skip requirements 1-4, start from requirement 5
/autopilot tasks.json --start-from 5
```

**Rollback to before a requirement started:**
```bash
# Undo all changes from requirement 3 onward
/autopilot rollback 3
```

Tags are named `autopilot/req-{id}/start` and automatically cleaned up when requirements complete successfully.

### Completion Summary

When autopilot finishes, it outputs a summary including:
- Requirements completed vs stuck
- Commits made with short descriptions
- Files created or modified
- Any blockers encountered

The summary is also appended to the notes file for reference.

### Notifications

Configure notifications in `autopilot.json` to be alerted when autopilot completes:

```json
{
  "notifications": {
    "enabled": true,
    "command": "notify-send 'Autopilot' 'Completed!'",
    "webhook": "https://your-webhook.com/endpoint",
    "ntfy": { "topic": "my-autopilot" }
  }
}
```

## Configuration: autopilot.json

The `autopilot.json` file stores project-specific settings. Created by `/autopilot init`, it should be committed to your repository.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gens-ai/autopilot/main/autopilot.schema.json",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "project": {

    "conventions": {
      "testFilePattern": "*.test.ts",
      "testDirectory": "src/__tests__",
      "sourceDirectory": "src"
    }
  },
  "feedbackLoops": {
    "typecheck": { "command": "npm run typecheck", "enabled": true },
    "tests": { "command": "npm test", "enabled": true },

  }
}
```

### Configuration Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `model` | Default Claude model for `run.sh` sessions (e.g. `"sonnet"`). `--model` flag overrides; `null` uses your Claude Code default — which may be a pricier tier than TDD grunt work needs |
| `project.type` | Project language/framework (nodejs, python, go, etc.) |
| `project.conventions` | Test file patterns and directory locations |
| `feedbackLoops` | Commands for typecheck, tests, and lint |
| `iterations` | Default max iterations per mode |
| `server` | Git server info for MCP integration |
| `codebase` | Discovered patterns and architecture notes |

### Manual Configuration

You can edit `autopilot.json` directly to:
- Adjust iteration limits for your workflow
- Change feedback loop commands
- Disable specific feedback loops (`"enabled": false`)
- Disable sandbox per feedback loop (`"sandbox": false`) for database/Docker tests
- Add architecture notes for Claude to reference

### Advanced Configuration

**Baseline failures** - If your project has pre-existing issues, configure baselines to avoid blocking:
```json
{
  "baseline": {
    "typecheck": { "errorCount": 5 },
    "tests": { "failingTests": ["flaky-test-name"] },
    "lint": { "errorCount": 10 }
  }
}
```

**Test types** - Requirements can specify different test types with separate commands:
```json
{
  "feedbackLoops": {
    "tests": {
      "command": "npm test",
      "commands": {
        "unit": "npm test -- --testPathPattern=unit",
        "integration": "npm test -- --testPathPattern=integration",
        "e2e": "npm run test:e2e"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Monorepo support** - Configure per-package feedback loops:
```json
{
  "workspaces": {
    "enabled": true,
    "packages": {
      "api": { "path": "packages/api", "feedbackLoops": { "tests": { "command": "npm test -w api" } } },
      "web": { "path": "packages/web", "feedbackLoops": { "tests": { "command": "npm test -w web" } } }
    }
  }
}
```

Then in your task file, scope requirements to specific packages:
```json
{
  "id": "5",
  "description": "Add user authentication API",
  "package": "api"
}
```

See `examples/autopilot-monorepo.json` and `examples/tasks-monorepo.json` for complete examples.

## Windows

Everything works in Git Bash. `install.sh` additionally drops a `.cmd` wrapper
next to each command, so `autopilot`, `autopilot-queue`, `autopilot-status`,
`autopilot-cleanup` and `autopilot-test-stories` also run from `cmd.exe`,
PowerShell and Windows Terminal. One template (`windows/wrapper.cmd`) serves all
of them: `cmd.exe` knows its own name, so `%~n0` resolves to the sibling bash
script and a new command needs no new wrapper.

### Running unattended

`autopilot` stops at its iteration cap -- and burns through those iterations in
seconds once Claude's usage limit is hit. To keep a run going across limits,
including sleeping out the reset window and waking the machine for it, use
[autopilot-forever](https://github.com/tahakdgn/autopilot-forever): a thin
wrapper around `run.sh` that also ships the panes for watching a run
(`autopilot-progress`, `autopilot-watch`) and a watchdog for sessions that hang
at startup (`autopilot-unstick`).

## Tips

- **Start with HITL**: Watch the first few iterations before going AFK
- **Approve tools once**: When prompted, choose "Always allow" for the session
- **Review commits**: Check git history when you return
- **Stop the wrapper**: Use `/autopilot stop` to stop run.sh, or Ctrl+C in that terminal
- **Cancel the loop**: Use `/autopilot cancel` to stop the hook-based loop mid-session
- **Keep PRDs small**: Smaller scope = better results
- **Use Sonnet for speed**: `--model sonnet` (or `"model": "sonnet"` in autopilot.json) is faster and cheaper for straightforward tasks; save the big models for `/prd` and `/tasks`, where the design judgment happens. Without either, sessions run on your personal default model — check what that is before a long run

## Troubleshooting

### Checking on a running loop

**Symptom:** You started `autopilot` a while ago (maybe in another terminal, maybe hours ago) and want to know if it's still healthy without hunting through `ps`, lock files, and the task JSON by hand.

**Solution:** Run `/autopilot status` (inside any Claude Code session in the project) or `autopilot-status` (from any terminal — no Claude session required). Both report: whether the wrapper process is alive and for how long, the loop's current iteration and time since the last hook activity, task progress (passed/stuck/invalid counts and the current in-progress requirement), recent commits, and whether the notes file has fallen out of sync with actual progress (harmless — git and the task JSON are ground truth). It changes nothing; safe to run anytime, including mid-run.

```bash
autopilot-status                                        # auto-discover any active loop in this repo
autopilot-status docs/autopilot/my-feature/my-feature.json  # check a specific task file
```

### Orphaned Claude processes accumulating

**Symptom:** System memory fills up, new Claude sessions get `Killed`, `ps aux | grep claude` shows dozens of old processes.

**Cause:** Claude Code spawns child processes (MCP servers, subagents, bun workers) that can outlive the parent session, especially when sessions are interrupted or force-killed. MCP servers started with `--daemon` double-fork and reparent to init, making them invisible to simple `kill` commands.

**Automatic prevention:** `run.sh` now kills the entire process tree after every session and on exit (Ctrl+C, SIGTERM, normal exit). This includes a sweep for daemonized processes that escaped the tree.

**Manual cleanup:**
```bash
# Kill background orphans only (safe - won't touch your interactive session)
autopilot-cleanup

# Preview what would be killed
autopilot-cleanup --dry-run

# Kill ALL Claude-related processes (including terminal-attached)
autopilot-cleanup --all

# Pre-run cleanup with autopilot
autopilot tasks.json --cleanup
```

### Stop hook firing repeatedly

If you cancel mid-run, the stop hook may fire multiple times as iterations unwind. This is normal - just wait for it to settle.

### Loop not starting

Ensure the hooks are installed correctly:
1. Check that `~/.claude/hooks/autopilot-stop-hook.sh` exists
2. Check that `~/.claude/settings.json` has the autopilot entry under `hooks.Stop` (`~/.claude/hooks.json` does NOT work — Claude Code never reads it)
3. Re-run `./install.sh` if needed, then restart Claude Code sessions (hook config is read at session startup)

### Task file not found

Ensure the task file path is correct and the file exists. Common locations:
- `docs/autopilot/<feature>/<feature>.json`
- `tasks/<feature>.json`

Run `/tasks <prd-file.md>` to generate a task file from a PRD.

### Tests not running

Ensure your project has commands for the feedback loops. Examples:

**Node.js (package.json)**
```json
{ "scripts": { "test": "jest", "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit", "lint": "eslint ." } }
```

**Python**
```bash
pytest                # tests
ruff check .          # lint
mypy .                # typecheck
```

**Go**
```bash
go test ./...         # tests
golangci-lint run     # lint
```

Claude will discover and use whatever commands are appropriate for your project.

### Missing jq dependency

If you see "jq: command not found" when running `autopilot` (bash wrapper):

```bash
# macOS
brew install jq

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install jq

# Fedora
sudo dnf install jq

# Arch
sudo pacman -S jq
```

### Tests fail with "ECONNREFUSED localhost:5432"

**Symptom:** Tests fail with connection errors even though Docker/database is running.

**Cause:** Claude Code's sandbox blocks Docker port forwarding.

**Solution:** Set `sandbox: false` for the tests feedback loop in `autopilot.json`:
```json
"feedbackLoops": {
  "tests": {
    "command": "npm test",
    "sandbox": false
  }
}
```

### Pre-existing test failures

**Symptom:** Autopilot won't commit because tests were already failing before you started.

**Solution:** Configure a baseline in `autopilot.json`:
```json
{
  "baseline": {
    "tests": { "failingTests": ["flaky-test-name"] },
    "lint": { "errorCount": 5 }
  }
}
```

Autopilot will only fail on NEW errors beyond the baseline. Ideally, fix pre-existing failures before using autopilot.

### Session interrupted mid-requirement

**Symptom:** Claude exited or crashed while working on a requirement.

**Recovery:**
1. Check the notes file (`*-notes.md`) for last known state
2. Check git log for any partial commits
3. If needed, rollback: `/autopilot rollback <requirement-id>`
4. Resume: `/autopilot tasks.json --start-from <requirement-id>`

### Circular dependencies between requirements

**Symptom:** Requirements depend on each other and none can start.

**Solution:** Review your task file and break the cycle:
1. Identify the circular chain (A → B → C → A)
2. Find which requirement can be made independent
3. Remove or change the `dependsOn` field to break the cycle
4. Re-run autopilot

### Requirement stuck but not obviously broken

**Symptom:** A requirement is marked `stuck: true` but the error isn't clear.

**Debugging steps:**
1. Read the `blockedReason` in the task JSON
2. Check the notes file for detailed error logs
3. Check analytics files in `docs/autopilot/<feature>/analytics/` for error patterns
4. Try running the test command manually to reproduce
5. Use `/autopilot rollback <id>` to reset and try again with modifications

### Context limits reached

**Symptom:** Claude's responses degrade or it starts forgetting previous work.

**Solutions:**
1. Use `autopilot` (bash wrapper) instead of `/autopilot` for automatic fresh context
2. Add `--batch 1` to complete one requirement per session
3. Break large task files into smaller ones (5-7 requirements each)
4. Restart Claude Code and resume with `--start-from`

### Invalid test detected (test passes before implementation)

**Symptom:** Requirement marked `invalidTest: true` in the task JSON.

**Causes:**
1. Feature already exists in the codebase
2. Test isn't actually testing the new behavior
3. Test assertion is incorrect

**Solution:** Review the test, fix it, then clear `invalidTest` and `invalidTestReason` from the JSON to retry.

### Thrashing detected

**Symptom:** Same error repeating multiple times, requirement marked stuck.

**Common causes and fixes:**

| Error Pattern | Cause | Fix |
|--------------|-------|-----|
| `ECONNREFUSED` | Sandbox blocking ports | Set `sandbox: false` |
| `Cannot find module` | Missing dependency | Run `npm install` |
| `ETIMEOUT` | Network unavailable | Check external services |
| Same assertion | Logic error | Re-read requirement |

### Analytics files empty

**Symptom:** Analytics files exist but contain `actualIterations: 0` and empty `requirements`.

**Cause:** Analytics are populated by `hooks/update-analytics.sh`, which runs after each session. If it's not being called, the files stay empty.

**Check:**
1. Ensure `hooks/update-analytics.sh` is executable: `chmod +x hooks/update-analytics.sh`
2. Ensure `jq` is installed (required by the script)
3. Ensure `analytics.enabled: true` in `autopilot.json`
4. Run manually to test: `./hooks/update-analytics.sh <analytics-file> <task-file> $(date +%s)`

## Uninstall

Remove the symlinks:

```bash
rm ~/.claude/commands/{prd,tasks,autopilot,autopilot:init,analyze}.md ~/.claude/AGENTS.md
rm ~/.local/bin/autopilot ~/.local/bin/autopilot-cleanup ~/.local/bin/autopilot-status ~/.local/bin/autopilot-queue ~/.local/bin/autopilot-test-stories
rm -f ~/.local/bin/autopilot*.cmd  # Windows wrappers
rm ~/.claude/hooks/autopilot-stop-hook.sh
```

Also remove the autopilot entry from `hooks.Stop` in `~/.claude/settings.json`.

Then delete the repo folder.
