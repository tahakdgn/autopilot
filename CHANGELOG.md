# Changelog

All notable changes to Autopilot will be documented in this file.

## 2026-09-07

### Added
- **Windows helpers shipped in the repo (`windows/`)** - `autopilot-forever`, `autopilot-progress`, `autopilot-watch` and `autopilot-unstick` previously existed only in local `~/.local/bin` installs, so a fresh clone gave no loop wrapper at all: `run.sh` stopped at its iteration cap and nothing restarted it across a usage limit. `install.sh` now installs all four, guarded on `uname` since they lean on `schtasks`, `winpty` and `chcp`. Documented in a new **Windows** section of the README, together with the two-pane Windows Terminal launcher.
- **`windows/wrapper.cmd`** - One `.cmd` template instead of nine byte-identical copies that differed only in the name they invoked. `cmd.exe` already knows its own name, so `%~n0` resolves to the sibling bash script; `install.sh` copies the template under each command name, and a tenth command needs no new file.
- **`.gitattributes`** - `core.autocrlf=true` is the Windows default and the repo pinned nothing, so a fresh clone handed out `run.sh` with a CR on every line. Git Bash tolerates that; another bash reports `$'\r': command not found`. Shell scripts are now pinned to LF, `.cmd` to CRLF.

## 2026-07-09

### Added
- **`VISION.md`** - Project vision document: the problem autopilot solves, the core thesis (human judgment up front, machine execution after, ground truth in between), ten design principles earned through dogfooding, explicit non-goals, and the roadmap toward a self-managing, queue-fed development pipeline. Linked from the README intro and from `CLAUDE.md` (as a study-before-design-decisions pointer for agent sessions).

## 2026-07-07

### Added
- **Per-project task queue (`docs/autopilot/queue.json`)** - Each project can now keep an ordered, committed queue of task files, so `autopilot` run with **no arguments** picks up the next runnable task list and drains the queue entry by entry. The queue stores only ordering and intent (position, `hold`, `notes`, informational timestamps); entry status (`queued`/`in-progress`/`done`/`stuck`) is always **derived** from the task file's own `passes`/`stuck`/`invalidTest` state at read time — never duplicated — so it cannot drift from ground truth (the class of bug fixed on 2026-07-05). Schema in `queue.schema.json`, example in `examples/queue.json`.
- **`autopilot queue` subcommand (`autopilot-queue`)** - Single owner of all queue read/write logic (`run.sh` and `status.sh` shell out to it): `list` (derived status + progress per entry, next-up pointer), `add` (validates the task file, idempotent, `--front`, `--notes`), `rm`, `hold`/`unhold` (park an entry without losing its place), `move`, `next` (machine-readable: prints the first runnable entry's path), and an internal `stamp` used by run.sh for start/finish timestamps. Symlinked to `~/.local/bin` by `install.sh` and dispatched via run.sh's existing subcommand mechanism.
- **Queue mode in `run.sh`** - Bare `autopilot` (lock: `.autopilot/queue.pid`) spawns a full task-mode run.sh per entry — same locking, batching, monitoring, and analytics as running the file directly — and advances only when the entry has nothing runnable left. A fully-stuck entry is flagged and skipped, not retried forever; a child that exits with runnable requirements remaining (stopped or crashed) halts the drain instead of plowing ahead. Between entries the wrapper returns to the branch it started on so each feature branches off the same base rather than stacking on the previous feature's branch, and a dirty working tree halts the drain. `--batch`/`--delay`/`--model` are forwarded to each entry's run. SIGUSR1/Ctrl+C forward gracefully to the active child.
- **`/tasks` auto-enqueues** - After saving a generated task JSON, `/tasks` now runs `autopilot queue add <file>` so new task files land in the queue automatically (skipped in `--refresh` mode and when the CLI isn't installed).

### Changed
- **`/autopilot stop` and `autopilot-status` know about queue drains** - Both now include `.autopilot/queue.pid` in their PID-file search; status prints the queue table (via `autopilot-queue list`) whenever a queue file exists, and stop documents the two-wrapper layout (queue parent + task-mode child) and that stopping either halts the drain gracefully.

### Fixed
- **Queue drain false-positives on pre-existing dirty-tree cruft** - The post-entry dirty-tree check that halts the drain on uncommitted changes was a single point-in-time `git status` snapshot, so any untracked/modified file unrelated to autopilot (a stray log, `.env.local`, editor droppings) would stop the drain after the first entry forever. Now diffs a before/after snapshot per entry and only treats *new* dirt introduced by that entry as blocking; pre-existing repo cruft and autopilot's own bookkeeping are ignored. Also quiets `git checkout`'s unlabeled merge-report output during the branch-return step. Found while dogfooding the queue feature end-to-end against real Claude sessions ([ISSUE-002](docs/issues/ISSUE-002-queue-drain-false-dirty-tree.md), [ISSUE-003](docs/issues/ISSUE-003-queue-dirty-check-blocks-on-preexisting-cruft.md)).
- **Task file committed on a feature branch vanishing from the queue** - A fully-finished queue entry (all requirements passed, real commits made) could show as `missing` afterward if its own task JSON got swept into a feature-branch commit: the branch-return `git checkout` correctly deletes any file tracked on the branch being left but absent from the branch being returned to. `commands/autopilot.md` now stages only the specific source/test files per requirement commit - never `git add -A`/`.`, and never the task/notes/analytics files - and `run.sh`'s branch-return step additionally restores the entry directory from the feature branch as a defense-in-depth safety net. Found live while dogfooding the real `/prd` → `/tasks` → `autopilot` pipeline ([ISSUE-004](docs/issues/ISSUE-004-committed-taskfile-vanishes-after-branch-return.md)).

## 2026-07-05 (late evening)

### Changed
- **Red phase scoped to the new test file** - On a large suite, running the full test command three times per requirement (Red, Green, Refactor) is expensive, and Red only needs to confirm the new test is red - it isn't a regression gate. Red now runs the test command scoped to just the new test file (e.g. passing its path as an argument), falling back to the full command if the runner's scoping syntax isn't clear. Green and Refactor are unchanged - they still run the full suite, since those are the actual pre-commit regression gates.

---

## 2026-07-05 (evening)

### Added
- **`/autopilot status` and `autopilot-status`** - Read-only health check for any active or recent autopilot loop: wrapper process liveness and elapsed time, loop iteration and time since last hook activity, task progress (passed/stuck/invalid counts, the current in-progress requirement, stuck reasons), recent commits, notes-file staleness, and analytics. Kills nothing, removes nothing, safe to run anytime including mid-run. Available both as a Claude Code mode (works from any session in the project) and a standalone terminal command (`status.sh`, symlinked by `install.sh`, requires no Claude session at all). Motivated by repeatedly hand-checking a long-running roadmap loop via ad-hoc `ps`/`jq`/`git log` commands. Discovered and fixed during testing: the between-iterations fallback (loop-state.md briefly absent) initially guessed the wrong task file when a directory held more than one `*.json` task file — it now asks the live wrapper process for its actual argv rather than glob-guessing, and refuses to guess (rather than silently picking one) when the process is gone and multiple candidates remain ambiguous.

---

## 2026-07-05

### Fixed
- **Wrapper self-collision ("another autopilot instance is running")** - Sessions spawned by `run.sh` found the wrapper's own `run.pid` lock next to the task file, treated it as a foreign autopilot instance per the Phase 0b collision check, and refused to work — while `run.sh` idle-killed each dead session after 30 minutes and spawned another, making zero progress indefinitely. `run.sh` now passes `--wrapper-pid $$` (and exports `AUTOPILOT_WRAPPER_PID`) to the session, and 0b exempts a `run.pid` whose PID matches: your own parent wrapper is not a collision. A run.pid with a *different* live PID still stops the session as a genuine collision.
- **Stop hook was never registered** - `install.sh` wrote the hook registration to `~/.claude/hooks.json`, a file Claude Code does not read (hooks live in `settings.json`). The within-session loop therefore never fired: `iteration` never advanced, completion never cleaned up state files, and sessions that stopped mid-requirement idled until run.sh's timeout killed them. `install.sh` now registers the hook in `~/.claude/settings.json` under `hooks.Stop` with the correct schema (jq-merged, idempotent, manual instructions if jq is missing) and removes an obsolete `hooks.json` if it contains only the autopilot entry. The shipped `hooks/hooks.json` template (obsolete format) is deleted.
- **Invalid "allow" decision in stop-hook output** - The hook emitted `{"decision": "allow"}`, which is not a valid Stop-hook value ("allow" is expressed by omitting `decision`). All allow paths now emit `{}`.
- **`/autopilot stop` couldn't find loops outside `docs/autopilot/`** - Stop mode only globbed `docs/autopilot/*/run.pid`, but `run.pid` lives next to the task file, which may be anywhere (e.g. `docs/tasks/prds/`). Stop mode now searches the repo with `find` for `run.pid`/`command.pid`.

### Added
- **`--state-dir` flag** - `run.sh` now passes the state directory to the session in argv (`--state-dir <taskfile-dir>`) instead of relying on `AUTOPILOT_STATE_DIR` env propagation, which does not reliably reach the session's tool shells. Previously the session could write `loop-state.md`/`stop-signal` to `.autopilot/` while run.sh and the stop hook watched the task-file directory, so neither saw the other's signals. The argv flag is authoritative; env resolution remains as fallback.
- **Stale-state guard in stop-hook** - A `loop-state.md` untouched for over 24 hours is a leftover from a dead run (active loops rewrite it every iteration, and run.sh deletes it when killing sessions). The hook now removes it and allows exit instead of hijacking whatever session next stops in that directory.
- **`docs/loop-mechanism.md`** - Architecture deep-dive on the loop machinery: the outer run.sh loop and inner Stop-hook loop, every coordination file (`run.pid`, `loop-state.md`, `stop-signal`), self-identification flags, hook registration, stop/cancel semantics, failure modes and their guards, and an end-to-end trace of one requirement. Linked from README's "How It Works".
- **`model` field in autopilot.json** - Sets the default Claude model for `run.sh`-spawned sessions. Precedence: `--model` CLI flag > `autopilot.json` `model` > user's Claude Code default. Previously, omitting `--model` silently ran every session on the user's personal default model — often the priciest tier — for TDD grunt work that a cheaper model handles fine. Added to the schema, template, and `/autopilot init` output (defaults to `null`).

### Changed
- **Idle timeouts raised from 10 to 30 minutes** - Both run.sh no-progress timeouts (task mode and command mode) now allow 30 minutes, since a single requirement's TDD cycle with typecheck + test + lint feedback loops can legitimately exceed 10 minutes without visible task-JSON progress.
- **`autopilot test-stories`** - Runs the story-testing session with `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=64000` so long domain-file findings aren't truncated.
- **README** - All references to `~/.claude/hooks.json` corrected to `settings.json` `hooks.Stop` (installation notes, file-structure trees, troubleshooting, uninstall).

---

## 2026-06-14

### Added
- **`autopilot test-stories <domain-file>`** — New subcommand for auditing existing features against user stories. Accepts a markdown domain file, generates a task JSON via `/test-user-stories`, then runs a fresh-session-per-story testing loop. Each session navigates to the feature, inspects code, writes inline findings (`- no issue` / `- fix:` / `- feature:` / `- suggestion:` / `- blocked:`), and checks permission gates. High-stakes stories (financials, permissions, destructive actions) also receive a negative browser test as an unauthorized user. A SUMMARY session writes a severity-triaged report to the domain file when all stories are done.
- **`commands/test-user-stories.md`** — Slash command that parses a domain-format user story file, discovers relevant code via codebase search, and produces a structured task JSON optimized for feature auditing rather than implementation. Framework-agnostic: adapts code discovery to any stack.
- **Subcommand dispatch in `run.sh`** — `autopilot <word>` now dispatches to a sibling `autopilot-<word>` script, enabling a clean `autopilot test-stories` CLI surface. Unknown subcommands print a helpful usage message.

---

## 2026-06-08

### Changed
- **Auto-init on missing config** - When a config-requiring mode (`/autopilot <task-file>`, `tests`, `lint`, `entropy`, `rollback`, `metrics`, `analyze`) is run with no `autopilot.json`, autopilot now auto-runs `init --force` and continues in the same session instead of aborting with a "not configured" message. Config-less modes (`init`, `stop`, `cancel`, command loop) are unaffected. If auto-init can't produce a valid config (e.g. not a git repo), it falls back to the manual-setup message and stops. Also documents the greenfield/scaffold-first pattern: feedback-loop tooling created by an early requirement stays enabled rather than being disabled during init.

---

## 2026-03-24

### Added
- **Feature branch per run** - TDD task mode now automatically creates (or checks out) a branch named after the feature before starting work. Branch name is derived from the task file basename (e.g. `my-feature.json` → branch `my-feature`).

---

## 2026-03-23

### Added
- **Parallel agent support (Phase 1)** - Multiple `run.sh` instances can now run simultaneously on different task files. Per-feature state files (PID, loop-state, stop-signal) are stored in the feature's directory (`docs/autopilot/<feature>/`) instead of the shared `.autopilot/` root. `run.sh` exports `AUTOPILOT_STATE_DIR` so the stop-hook finds the correct loop-state file per instance.
- **`hooks/git-commit` commit mutex** - New wrapper around `git commit` that serializes commits via `mkdir` lock (POSIX atomic). Prevents staging-area races when parallel agents commit simultaneously.
- **Parallel awareness in `autopilot.md`** - Phase 0c instructs agents to check for sibling `run.pid` files and follow safe git practices (specific file adds, serialized commits via `hooks/git-commit`) when running in parallel.

### Changed
- **`CLAUDE.md`** - Added superpowers skill output conventions: plans save to `docs/plans/` (not `docs/superpowers/plans/`).

---

## 2026-03-13

### Changed
- **PRD option recommendations** - When asking clarifying questions with lettered options, the agent now recommends which option it thinks is best and explains why. Users can still pick any option.

### Fixed
- **Git tag conflicts** - Autopilot failed when resuming incomplete requirements because `git tag autopilot/req-ID/start` errors on existing tags. Changed instruction to use `git tag -f` which overwrites stale tags from prior attempts. Affects resumed runs, post-rollback retries, and un-stuck requirements.

---

## 2026-03-11

### Changed
- **PRD one-at-a-time questions** - Clarifying questions are now asked one per message in a conversational flow instead of dumped all at once. Announces question count upfront, shows progress (e.g., "Question 3 of ~12"), and acknowledges each answer briefly before moving on.

---

## 2026-03-08

### Changed
- **PRD clarifying questions** - Changed from "ask 3-5 critical questions" to "ask as many as a professional PM/senior dev would ask a client." Added follow-up question rounds, expanded guidelines with 14 areas to probe (users, flows, edge cases, data, permissions, integrations, performance, etc.). PRDs no longer have an "Open Questions" section — all questions must be resolved before writing.
- **File paths restructured** - All generated files now live in `docs/autopilot/<feature-name>/` instead of `docs/tasks/prds/`. Analytics go in `docs/autopilot/<feature-name>/analytics/`. Standalone mode notes (tests, lint, entropy) go in `docs/autopilot/<mode>/YYYY-MM-DD-notes.md`. Updated `prd.md`, `tasks.md`, `autopilot.md`, `analyze.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `autopilot.schema.json`, `run.sh`, `install.sh`, `README.md`, and example files.
- **Analytics directory derivation** - `run.sh` now derives the analytics directory from the task file path instead of reading a global config value.

---

## 2026-02-22

### Fixed
- **Analytics population** - Analytics files were always empty (`actualIterations: 0`, `requirements: []`, `summary: null`) because population was a prompt instruction that the LLM ignored. Analytics are now populated by infrastructure: `update-analytics.sh` reads task JSON, git tags, and commit history to derive requirement statuses, iteration counts, files written, and summary statistics. The LLM prompt is reduced to error logging only.
- **Stop-hook prompt extraction** - The `sed`-based YAML frontmatter extraction (`sed '1,/^---$/d' | sed '1,/^---$/d'`) never worked: the first `sed` consumed both `---` delimiters, leaving the second `sed` with no delimiter to find, so it deleted everything. Replaced with `awk '/^---$/{n++; next} n>=2'` which correctly counts delimiters. This fixes within-session looping — previously the hook always allowed exit on first stop, forcing all iteration to happen via run.sh session restarts.

### Added
- **`hooks/update-analytics.sh`** - Shell script that populates analytics from ground truth. Called by both `run.sh` (after each session) and `stop-hook.sh` (on completion/max-iterations). Derives requirement status from task JSON flags, `startedAt` from git tags, `iterations` from commit counts, `filesWritten` from git diff. Preserves LLM-written `errors[]` data.
- **`actualIterations` tracking in stop-hook** - The hook now increments `actualIterations` in the analytics file on each loop iteration, and writes `analytics_file`/`task_file` paths from loop-state frontmatter.
- **Analytics discovery in run.sh** - After each session, `run.sh` finds the matching analytics file by task name stem and calls `update-analytics.sh` to populate it.

### Changed
- **`analytics.schema.json`** - `toolCalls`, `phases`, and `filesRead` now accept `null` with descriptions noting they are optional LLM-dependent fields that infrastructure does not track.
- **`autopilot.md` ANALYTICS_INSTRUCTION** - Reduced from full analytics tracking to error logging only. Infrastructure handles iteration counting, requirement status, file tracking, and summary generation.
- **`autopilot.md` loop-state template** - Now includes `analytics_file:` and `task_file:` in YAML frontmatter so the stop-hook can access them.

---

## 2026-02-13

### Changed
- **run.sh permissions** - Replaced `--dangerously-skip-permissions` with `--allowedTools` to pre-approve tools individually. This avoids the interactive bypass permissions confirmation prompt that Claude Code now shows on every session, while keeping manual Claude Code sessions fully permissioned. A one-time workspace trust prompt appears the first time `autopilot` runs in a new project directory.

---

## 2026-02-04

### Fixed
- **Orphaned process cleanup** - `run.sh` now kills the entire process tree (MCP servers, subagents, bun workers) when terminating Claude sessions, not just the main process. Previously, child processes would reparent to init and accumulate indefinitely, consuming memory until the system killed new sessions.

### Added
- **`kill_session()` helper** - Collects all descendant PIDs before sending SIGTERM, then force-kills survivors after 5 seconds. Prevents orphaned processes from accumulating across autopilot runs.
- **EXIT trap cleanup** - `run.sh` now cleans up the active Claude session on any exit (normal, Ctrl+C, SIGTERM), ensuring no child processes are left behind.
- **`--cleanup` flag** - `run.sh --cleanup` kills stale background Claude/MCP processes before starting a new run. Useful after ungraceful terminations.
- **`cleanup.sh`** - Standalone script to find and kill orphaned Claude Code processes. Supports `--dry-run` to preview and `--all` to include terminal-attached sessions. Installed as `autopilot-cleanup` CLI command.
- **SIGINT/SIGTERM handling** - `run.sh` now traps Ctrl+C and SIGTERM for graceful shutdown with full process tree cleanup, instead of leaving orphans.

---

## 2026-01-24

### Changed
- **Renamed `/init` to `/autopilot init`** - The init command is now namespaced under `/autopilot init` to avoid conflicting with Claude Code's native `/init` command (which creates CLAUDE.md files)
  - File renamed from `commands/init.md` to `commands/autopilot:init.md`
  - Symlink updated accordingly
  - Re-run `./install.sh` to update your symlinks

---

## 2026-01-18

### Added
- **Command loop mode** - Run any slash command repeatedly with fresh sessions
  - Usage: `autopilot /my-command --max 5` or `/autopilot /my-command --max 5`
  - Runs the command N times, starting a fresh Claude session each iteration
  - Useful for repetitive tasks, batch processing, or running review commands multiple times
  - Default iterations configurable via `iterations.command` in autopilot.json (default: 10)
- **`--max N` flag** for run.sh command mode to specify iteration count
- **`iterations.command`** configuration in autopilot.json schema and template

### Changed
- **run.sh** now supports two modes: task file mode (existing) and command loop mode (new)
- **Argument parsing** for command mode uses explicit `--max N` to avoid ambiguity with command arguments

---

## 2026-01-15

### Added
- **Model selection** - `run.sh` now supports `--model` flag to choose Claude model (opus, sonnet, haiku, or full model name)
  - Example: `autopilot tasks.json --model sonnet` for faster, cheaper runs
  - Example: `autopilot tasks.json --model haiku --batch 5` for maximum speed
- **Debug logging** - Stop-hook includes DEBUG statements for troubleshooting completion detection
- **Sentinel stop file** - Autopilot writes `.autopilot/stop-signal` when all requirements complete, signaling `run.sh` to exit
- **Active session monitoring** - `run.sh` now runs Claude in background and actively monitors for completion
  - Checks task JSON every 2 seconds for progress
  - Detects batch completion and terminates for fresh context
  - Idle detection: restarts after 30s idle if progress was made (prevents stale context)
  - Timeout detection: terminates after 10 minutes with no progress (prevents stuck sessions)
- **Test fixtures** - Added `tests/fixtures/` with minimal autopilot.json and tasks-simple.json for development testing

### Fixed
- **Loop termination** - Stop-hook now sends SIGTERM to parent Claude process when complete, ensuring Claude actually exits (previously just returned "allow" which didn't force termination)
- **Batch completion detection** - `run.sh` now monitors task JSON for progress and terminates Claude when batch size is reached, avoiding context window exhaustion

---

## 2026-01-13

### Added
- **Quick Start guide** - New 5-minute getting started section with decision tree for choosing execution method
- **Expanded troubleshooting** - 15+ common issues with detailed solutions (was 4 items)
- **Monorepo examples** - `examples/autopilot-monorepo.json` and `examples/tasks-monorepo.json`
- **Mode: Metrics** - New command `/autopilot metrics` (alias for analyze with aggregation focus)
- **Dependency validation** - `run.sh` now checks for `jq` and `claude` CLI before running
- **JSON validation** - `run.sh` validates task file is valid JSON with requirements array
- **Progress visibility** - `run.sh` shows completed/stuck counts after each session

### Fixed
- **Iterations mismatch** - `init.md` now uses correct defaults (15/10/15/10) matching template and docs

### Improved
- **Error messages** - Configuration errors now include actionable fix instructions
- **Task file errors** - Better messages with common locations and how to generate

---

## 2026-01-13 (earlier)

### Added
- **Built-in loop mechanism** - Autopilot now includes its own stop-hook, eliminating the dependency on the external ralph-loop plugin
  - `hooks/stop-hook.sh` - Intercepts exit attempts, re-feeds prompts for iteration
  - `hooks/hooks.json` - Hook configuration template
  - State stored in `.autopilot/loop-state.md` with YAML frontmatter
- **`/autopilot cancel` command** - Cancel an active hook-based loop by removing the state file
  - Different from `/autopilot stop` which signals the run.sh wrapper
  - Graceful cancellation - current work completes before loop exits
- **Improved stop-hook features** (based on ralph-loop):
  - Reads transcript path from hook input JSON (not environment variable)
  - Uses Perl regex for robust `<promise>` tag extraction
  - Atomic iteration increment using temp file + move pattern
  - Supports unlimited iterations when max_iterations = 0
  - Better system message with promise guidance

### Changed
- **No external plugin required** - Autopilot is now fully self-contained
- **Installation** - `./install.sh` now installs hooks to `~/.claude/hooks/` and creates `~/.claude/hooks.json`
- **Loop state location** - Now uses `.autopilot/loop-state.md` (project-local) instead of `.claude/ralph-loop.local.md`

### Removed
- **Ralph Loop plugin dependency** - No longer requires `claude plugins:install claude-plugins-official`

## 2026-01-11

### Added
- **Session Analytics** - Per-session analytics files track iterations, errors, timing, and waste patterns
  - Stored in `docs/tasks/analytics/` with timestamped filenames
  - Schema defined in `analytics.schema.json`
  - Example file: `examples/analytics-user-auth-session.json`
- **Thrashing Detection** - Automatically detects when the same error repeats consecutively
  - Configurable threshold via `analytics.thrashingThreshold` (default: 3)
  - Immediately marks task as stuck when thrashing detected
  - Logs pattern to analytics for post-session analysis
- **`/autopilot analyze` command** - Post-session analysis of analytics files
  - Calculates efficiency score (productive vs wasted iterations)
  - Identifies waste patterns (thrashing, environment issues, missing context)
  - Generates suggested AGENTS.md entries and autopilot.json changes
  - Supports `--last`, `--since Nd`, `--task <name>`, `--clear` flags
- **Analytics configuration** in `autopilot.json`:
  - `analytics.enabled` - Toggle analytics (default: true)
  - `analytics.directory` - Where to store files (default: `docs/tasks/analytics`)
  - `analytics.thrashingThreshold` - Consecutive errors before abort (default: 3)
  - `analytics.trackToolCalls` - Track tool usage per requirement
  - `analytics.trackFileAccess` - Track files read/written per requirement

### Changed
- **TDD mode** now logs errors, iterations, and timing to analytics file
- **Stuck handling** distinguishes between thrashing (same error) and regular stuck (different approaches failed)

## 2026-01-10

### Changed
- **AGENTS.md trimmed to 63 lines** - Removed Learnings section (progress tracker), condensed TDD Pitfalls. Keeps file purely operational per Ralph Playbook recommendation.
- **Language patterns documented** - Added Language Patterns section to CLAUDE.md with proven phrasings ("study" vs "read", "capture the why", etc.)
- **Subagent parallelization guidance** - Added section to CLAUDE.md explaining when to use parallel (exploration) vs sequential (execution) subagents

### Added
- **Codebase analysis in `/tasks`** - Before generating tasks, `/tasks` now explores the codebase to understand existing patterns, utilities, and implementations
- **Gap analysis** - Each requirement is categorized as `create`, `extend`, `modify`, or `already-done` based on what code already exists
- **`codeAnalysis` field** - Requirements now include rich context: `existingFiles`, `relatedTests`, `patterns`, and `targetFiles` (modify/create)
- **`--refresh` flag for `/tasks`** - Re-analyze incomplete requirements while preserving completed ones; useful for mid-implementation course correction
- **`tasks.schema.json`** - JSON Schema for task files, enabling validation and editor autocomplete
- **Phase-numbered structure** - Both `/tasks` and `autopilot.md` now use explicit phase numbering (Phase 0 for pre-flight, Phase 1+ for execution)
- **Critical guardrails section** - `autopilot.md` now has Phase 99999+ with escalating priority guardrails:
  - 99999: Feedback loops before commits
  - 999999: Never commit on failure
  - 9999999: Search before implementing
  - 99999999: No placeholders or TODOs
  - 999999999: Single source of truth
- **Guardrails in AGENTS.md** - Added Guardrails section with search-first, no-placeholders, and single-source-of-truth rules
- **Acceptance criteria for requirements** - New `acceptance` array defines specific, testable outcomes that become test cases in TDD Red phase

### Changed
- **TDD Red phase** - Now requires tests covering ALL acceptance criteria before proceeding to Green phase
- **Code-aware TDD descriptions** - Test and implementation descriptions now reference specific files, patterns, and utilities discovered during analysis
- **Example tasks file** - `examples/tasks-user-auth.json` updated with `codeAnalysis` examples showing the new structure
- **"Don't assume not implemented" guardrail** - Built into `/tasks` Phase 1 and `autopilot.md` guardrails, ensuring Claude searches before implementing

### Inspiration
- Gap analysis, phase numbering, and guardrail patterns adapted from [Ralph Playbook](https://github.com/ghuntley/ralph-playbook) by Geoffrey Huntley

## 2026-01-09

### Added
- **run.sh** - Token-frugal wrapper script that runs Claude in a loop with fresh context per requirement
- **--batch N flag** - Limit requirements completed per session for manual token management
- **Resume support** - `--start-from <id>` flag to resume from specific requirement
- **Rollback mechanism** - Git tags created before each requirement (`autopilot/req-{id}/start`), with `/autopilot rollback <id>` mode
- **Completion summary report** - Shows completed vs stuck requirements, commits made, and files modified when autopilot finishes
- **Progress tracking** - Structured YAML log in notes file tracking timing, commits, and files per requirement
- **Completion notifications** - Desktop notifications, webhooks, or ntfy.sh integration via `notifications` config
- **Test type support** - Requirements can specify `testType` (unit, integration, e2e) with different test commands
- **Issue tracker integration** - Link commits to GitHub Issues, auto-update issues on completion
- **Monorepo/workspace support** - Per-package feedback loops with `workspaces` config
- **Metrics tracking** - Optional collection of success rates, timing, and common stuck points
- **Auto-documentation** - Optional changelog/README updates after requirements complete
- **Example files** - `/examples/` directory with brainstorm, PRD, tasks, and notes examples
- **Sandbox config per feedback loop** - Control sandbox mode individually (for database/Docker tests)
- **Baseline failures** - Ignore pre-existing typecheck/test/lint failures via `baseline` config
- **Coverage targeting** - Prioritize critical paths, exclude generated files, focus on recent changes
- **Dependency ordering** - Requirements can specify `dependsOn` for parallel execution planning
- **TDD pitfalls documentation** - AGENTS.md section on test isolation and fixture conflicts
- **CLAUDE.md** - Context file for Claude Code with project overview, architecture, and key concepts

### Changed
- **Explicit TDD enforcement** - Tests must fail before implementation, flagged as invalid if they pass early
- **Smarter code-simplifier** - Explicitly tracks files modified per requirement, passes specific file list
- **Feedback loop joining** - Commands explicitly joined with `&&` for proper error handling
- **Iteration counts** - Updated documentation explaining expected iterations per requirement
- **Notes file bootstrap** - Gracefully handles missing notes file on first run, creates with template

### Fixed
- **Argument parsing** - Fixed Ralph Loop skill args with semicolons/parentheses being interpreted as shell commands
- **Pre-existing failures** - Baseline config allows autopilot to continue despite existing issues

### Added
- **Token Frugality Mode** - All prompts now include instructions to minimize token usage
  - Read notes file first to understand current state
  - Be concise - do not explain, just act
  - Use targeted file reads (line ranges instead of full files)
  - Don't re-read files already summarized in notes
- **Structured Notes Format** - Notes files maintain a `Current State` section for quick state reconstruction
- **Token Frugality section** in README explaining the optimization strategies

### Changed
- **Lower default iterations** for all modes to encourage frequent session restarts:
  - tasks: 50 → 15
  - tests: 30 → 10
  - lint: 50 → 15
  - entropy: 30 → 10
- Updated autopilot.json schema with new defaults
- Updated autopilot.template.json with new defaults
- All mode prompts rewritten to be more concise

### Fixed
- Explicitly skip completed requirements (`passes: true`) in TDD mode

## 2025-01-08

### Added
- Initial release
- `/prd` command - Create human-readable PRDs with clarifying questions
- `/tasks` command - Convert PRDs to machine-readable JSON with TDD phases
- `/autopilot` command with four modes:
  - TDD task completion (default)
  - Test coverage improvement
  - Lint error fixing
  - Entropy/code cleanup
- `/autopilot init` command for project configuration
- TDD enforcement (Red → Green → Refactor cycle)
- Code-simplifier integration during refactor phase
- Stuck handling after 3 failed iterations
- Feedback loops (typecheck, tests, lint) before commits
- Progress tracking via notes files
- Learnings logged to AGENTS.md
- Symlink-based installation for easy updates
